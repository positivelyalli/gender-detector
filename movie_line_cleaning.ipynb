Now it seems to me that despite varying shades of opinion you all agree that we must remain. When the rebellion first began there were not even shades of opinion. All the newspapers even the left-wing ones wanted the rebellion suppressed. And we were sent here for this very reason. And we are neither madmen nor sadists gentlemen.

No I don't enjoy being a part of the weaker sex and for that reason everyone around me is going to suffer. So there's your psychoanalysis Doctor Freud. Now are you in or are you out?\n",

      "This is a lot worse than \"Betty.\"\n",
      "That's it? Hell my mom chased my dad around with a knife when she had it. She made us call her a different name. She'd say \"You're talking to Betty now\" and we'd leave the house for a few days.\n",
      "You use the word \"fucking.\" You're sexualizing things. Stop berating yourself. It's okay to have sex.\n",
      "You say you killed a man and don't remember it. Couldn't you have had sex and not remember it? It's sexual. Why did you choose \"eating him\" as the method of killing?\n",
      "So I asked the bartender what \"coyote ugly\" meant. It's like the \"bagger\" system. You know a two- bagger -- someone so ugly that you need two bags -- one bag to put on their head and another one in case it blows off. Or a three-bagger...\n",

      "Then let's begin with the story itself. It's a story of the Grail myth...And although there are several variations my favorite begins with the Fisher King as a young boy... who had to spend a night alone in the forest to prove his courage... and during that night he is visited by a sacred vision. Out of the fire appears the Holy Grail - God's highest symbol of divine grace. And a voice says to the boy \"You shall be the guardian of the Grail that it may heal the hearts of men\"...But the boy was overcome ...Innocent and foolish he was blinded by greater visions - a life ahead filled with beauty and glory hope and power...Tears filled his eyes as he sensed his own... invincibility. A boy's tears of naive wonder and inspiration. and in this state of...radical amazement...he felt for a brief moment not like a boy but like God...  ...And so he reached into the fire to take the Grail. And the Grail vanished. And the boy hands were left caught in the flames...leaving him wounded and ashamed at what his recklessness had lost him. When he became King he was determined to reclaim his destiny and find the Grail... But with each year that passed with each campaign he fought the Grail remained lost and this wound he suffered in the fire grew worse... He became a bitter man. Life for him lost it's reason. With each disappointment with each betrayal... with each loss ... this wound would grow... Soon the land began to spoil from neglect and his people starved...Until finally the King lost all faith in God's existance and in man's value...He lost his ability to love or be loved And he was so sick with experience... that he started to die. As the years went on his bravest knights would search for the Grail that would heal their King and make them the most respected and valued men in the land but to no avail.  Pretty soon finding the Grail became a ruthless struggle between ambitious men vying for the King's power which only confirmed the King's worst suspicions of man causing his wound to grow. His only hope he thought was death. Then one day a fool was brought in to the King to cheer him.  He was a simple-minded man... not particularly skilled...or admired... He tells the King some jokes...sing him some songs but the King feels even worse...Finally the fool says \"What is it that hurts you so much? How can I help?\"...And the King says \"I need a sip of water to cool my throat\"...So the fool takes a cup from the bedstand fills it with water and hands it to the King...Suddenly the King feels a lot better. And when he looks to his hands he sees that it was the Holy Grail the fool handed him...an ordinary cup that had been beside his bed all along...And the King asks \"How can this be?...how could you find what all my knights and wisest men could not find\"? And the fool answers \"I don't know. I only knew you were thirsty.\"... And for the first time since he was a boy the King felt more than a man - not because he was touched by God's glory...but rather by the compassion of a fool.\n",
